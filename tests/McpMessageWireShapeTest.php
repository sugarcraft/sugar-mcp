/**
 * {@see McpMessage::toJson()} IS THE WIRE. {@see McpMessage::toArray()} IS AN
 * INSPECTION VIEW. THE TWO HAVE NEVER BEEN THE SAME THING.
 *
 * E479 recorded that `toArray()` "NOW emits a key that is not JSON-RPC", the
 * `resultSet` sentinel round 55 added, and asked whether the method is a wire
 * serialiser or a debug view. The premise of the "now" is FALSE, and the tree
 * says so rather than an argument: `git log -L` on the method (sugar-crush's
 * original of this class) shows `isNotification` — equally not a JSON-RPC key
 * — present in the very commit that created the file (`790e9464f`), long
 * before the sentinel existed (`f2f9f6985`). And that is not the only way the
 * shape is not the wire: `toArray()` emits `id`, `method`, `params`, `result`
 * AND `error` unconditionally, so a plain request comes out carrying a null
 * `result` beside a null `error` — a pair JSON-RPC 2.0 does not permit in one
 * message at all.
 *
 * So `resultSet` did not change this method's character. It was an inspection
 * view from its first line, it still is, and this file says so in the one place
 * a reader will look and pins it so the answer stays given.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE HARD-CODES WHICH KEYS ARE WIRE KEYS. The JSON-RPC key set is
 * DERIVED from what `toJson()` actually emits across a corpus of message shapes,
 * so the rows below survive a legal addition to the protocol surface and red on
 * an illegal one. A list written out here would have to be maintained by hand
 * and would be exactly as trustworthy as the sentence E479 got wrong.
 *
 * THE ONE THING NOT TO DO, and E479 says it too: do not "fix" `toArray()` by
 * copying `toJson()`'s shape. {@see \SugarCraft\Mcp\StdioMcpServer::start()}
 * reads `parseTools($listResponse->toArray())`, which wants `['result']['tools']`
 * — a serialiser that dropped an absent `result` would take the tool list with
 * it. That is pinned here as well.
 *
 * Moved from sugar-crush/tests with the lane-A2 fold — the canonical tests
 * live with the canonical class.
